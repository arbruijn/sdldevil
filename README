Running SDLDevil
================
$ ./src/sdldevil
notice that currently the config subdirectory must reside in the
current path from where you are running SDLDevil.

Notice: SDLDevil will ask for configuration settings (Descent
Directories etc) in textmode, so you currently need to run it from
console. This will change in further versions.

Notice: For the Devil Path you can choose "."

Notice: Selecting a graphics driver is not neccessary


Known bugs
==========
See file TODO


Troubleshooting / FAQ
=====================
Q: Mouse actions in conjunction with the ALT key do not work
A: Check your window mananger settings. For example XFce traps
