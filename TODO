SDLDevil ToDos Brainstorm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


mandatory:
partially done: all code that depends on sizeof(long) == 4 which breaks on 64bit machines
user report (pumo): specific levels crash when loading or showing bogus infos
  DMB2 created levels showing this issue? need further investigation here.


major:
separate configurable descent binary, data and mission dirs
graphical configuration tool
keyrepeat
fix: littlebulbs in texture lists are garbage (opt_txt.c)
texture set not loaded correctly when loading new level on unix (uppercase)
fix ALOT of memory leaks (according to valgrind)


minor:
nice title picture
cleanup: format all code in k&r style
cleanup: rewrite large macro code to inline (mainly for debugging)
fix: Texture animation arrows are only black, every second should be white
cleanup: get rid of all palette stuff except where it is needed (textures...)


new features:
fullscreen/window option
free screen res selection
optional opengl plotsys
option for redefining keymappings (for NEO2 users like me :-) )


DONE:
fix: framedbox w/ border > 1 draws too far?
fix: menus behaving wrong (maybe event system?)
fix: stalled gui when opening new level
port: font loader for devil font => converted and integrated as header file
fix: wrong text drawing when updating only text rect 
fix: colorkey for ws_copybitmap
port: render texture lists
port: plotroutines to work properly
fix: crash when selection circle leaves left border of screen
fix: crash when closing level 
fix: fit texture window leaving black area on bottom
port all allegro (only timer?) stuff to sdl - to drop another dependency => removed completely
optimize mainloop to sleep() for the rest of the timeslice
graphic bug drawing the texture alignment lines outside of the texture
fix: background on transparent textures in texture lists
fix: initial / na drawing in wall/robot/reactor texture view
fix: small textures in list show garbage
fix: untag all segfaults
fix: wrong robot texture display
fix: wrong reactor texture display
fix: wrong cursor positioning when clicking textbox
port: file load / save dialogs
fix: fit texture align window not showing texture
fix: crash when changing d2 texture and leaving editor (trying to free() something strange)
fix: handling drives in windows
fix: lookup when trying to access .. in rootdir 
port: savestate stuff
fix: info message boxes disappear immediately (wins/w_event.c, int w_okcancel)
fix: no movement of corridor wizard end possible - only bending it
fix: doubleclick not working
Version and Title 
SDLWindow title
port: hogmanager still crashing
lookup in full rendering when entering level
